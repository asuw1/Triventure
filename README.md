# Triventure
Triventure is a 2D platofrmer with a challenging twist, as you progress, the levels get harder and harder with unique obstacles meeting you in every turn! Triventure was inspired many games like Geometry Dash and Super Mario Bros, and wears a charming 8-bit graphical design influenced by 80s era video games.
Triventure was made as an end-of-semester project for an Object Oriented Programming course, and got 3rd place in the Alfaisal Mini-Games exhibit between 22 teams and 139 students.
