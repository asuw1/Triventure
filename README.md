# Introduction
  Triventure is a 2D platformer with a challenging twist, as you progress, the levels get harder and harder with unique obstacles meeting you at every turn! Triventure was inspired by many games like Geometry Dash and Super Mario Bros, and wears a charming 8-bit graphical design influenced by 80s era video games.
Triventure was made as an end-of-semester project for an Object Oriented Programming course and got 3rd place in the Alfaisal Mini-Games exhibit between 22 teams and 139 students.

In this version, the game was first called Recventure, and had the same idea but instead of a triangular main character, it was instead a rectangle. This was the barebones version of the game, where you can move the blue square, the red square was an enemy, and the yellow square was a collectible, with no levels and no menu screen.

Here, we added some sprites, changed the name, and added a background with a blue sky and green grass. I had an idea of making the enemies oscillate in one place with a set amplitude to make the player have to time their jumps, the enemies were going to be more forgiving by simply inflicting 10 damage on the player, instead of just dying on contact.

This was the first demo of the tutorial level where I decided, for lack of time, to simply make the red squares a death-on-contact mechanic, and I fleshed out the tutorial to show the controls, enemies, and platforms.

This was level 2, it was a more challenging level with smaller platforms, bigger jumps, and a need for accurate timing.
